### What is Jasmine?
```From Wikipedia```
Jasmine is an open source testing framework for JavaScript.[4] It aims to run on any JavaScript-enabled platform, to not intrude on the application nor the IDE, and to have easy-to-read syntax. It is heavily influenced by other unit testing frameworks, such as ScrewUnit, JSSpec, JSpec, and RSpec.

## Project Objective
* No test should be dependent on the results of another
* Callbacks should be used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested
* Error handling should be implemented for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access
* When complete, all of your tests should pass

## To Run
1. Clone/Download and extract to computer
2. Open ```index.html``` in the browser of your choice;be connected to internet since network requests are made for jasmine.
3. Test results are displayed at the bottom of the page.
